## Summary: 
**Logistic regression and random forest models with applications in credit score modeling.**

This project demoonstrates techniques in data preprosessing in categorical and numerical variables. In addition, anomaly detections, dropping outliers, under-sampling, and over-sampling techiques are explored, as those are common topics in Explanatory data analysis prior to modeling.

Finally, a comparison of two different powerful models are presented, with report attached:
