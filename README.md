## Summary: 
**Logistic regression and random forest models with applications in credit score modeling.**

This project demonstrates techniques in data preprocessing in categorical and numerical variables. In addition, anomaly detections, dropping outliers, under-sampling, and over-sampling techniques are explored, as those are common topics in Explanatory data analysis before modeling.

Finally, a comparison of two different powerful models is presented, with the report attached:
